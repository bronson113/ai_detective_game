The goal is to create a cool interactive experience for the player to solve. Here are the scenario. 

Mystery Scenario: The Silent Witness

Overview:
Set in the 2020, the player takes on the role of a sharp detective in a small, foggy coastal town called Hawthorne Bay. The kind and generous widow, Mrs. Eleanor Sloane, has been found dead in her grand, crumbling mansion, Windward House. The death appears to be a suicide, but there are strange circumstances surrounding it, and a growing suspicion of foul play. The player must solve the mystery by piecing together evidence, interviewing suspects, and unraveling secrets of the past.

Crime Scene:
    Location: Mrs. Sloane's study, a large room on the second floor of Windward House, overlooking the ocean.
    Body Position: Mrs. Sloane is found slumped over her desk with a gunshot wound to the head. A pistol lies near her hand, and a single shot has been fired.
    Time of Death: Roughly 10 PM the night before, according to the town's doctor.
    Details:
        No sign of forced entry into the house.
        No footprints or fingerprints other than Mrs. Sloane's.
        A suicide note lies on the desk, claiming that "the guilt of her past sins is too much to bear."
        The window in the study is open, and the ocean breeze has scattered papers on the floor.

Key Details:
    The Gun: The pistol has no fingerprints on it, not even Mrs. Sloane’s. The gunpowder residue is found on her hand, suggesting she fired it. But the lack of prints is suspicious. Could someone have wiped them off?
    The Suicide Note: The note is in Mrs. Sloane's handwriting, but on closer examination, it seems shaky, as though written under duress or with her hand guided. There are ink smudges on it, implying she hesitated or someone tampered with it.
    The Window: The window in the study is wide open, but the weather that night was unusually cold and stormy. Mrs. Sloane was known to dislike the cold, so it’s odd that she would leave the window open. There’s also a faint, muddy footprint near the window—too small to be Mrs. Sloane's size.
    The Locked Door: The study door was locked from the inside, and the only way to enter was with Mrs. Sloane’s key, which was found in her pocket. However, the lock mechanism is old and faulty—someone with enough skill could have unlocked it from the outside.

Suspects:
    Arthur Greene (Lawyer and Family Friend): Arthur has known Mrs. Sloane for years and handled her late husband’s estate. He was seen at the house earlier in the day, supposedly dropping off paperwork. Rumors suggest that Arthur was in financial trouble and might have been pressuring Mrs. Sloane to alter her will. Could he have forced her to sign something before staging the suicide?
    Vivian Crowley (Neighbor and Socialite): Vivian lived next door and often visited Mrs. Sloane for tea. They were close, but their friendship soured after a mysterious argument a few months ago. Vivian insists they patched things up, but witnesses claim they overheard a heated argument the day before Mrs. Sloane’s death. Vivian also has a fascination with old locks and mechanics, a known hobby she picked up from her late father, a locksmith.
    Thomas "Tommy" Ward (Former Servant): Thomas was once Mrs. Sloane's butler but was dismissed under strange circumstances a year ago. He had a close relationship with Mrs. Sloane’s late husband, who left him a small inheritance. There are rumors that Mrs. Sloane fired him because he was blackmailing her over an old secret. He’s been spotted lurking around the mansion recently.
    Margaret Sloane (Estranged Daughter): Margaret had a rocky relationship with her mother, especially after her father's death. She left town years ago after being disowned for eloping with a man her mother disapproved of. She returned to town unexpectedly the day before the death but claims she never saw her mother. Town gossip suggests Margaret was seeking a reconciliation—or possibly her share of the family fortune.

Clues & Evidence:
    Sloane Family Portrait: In Mrs. Sloane’s study, there's a portrait of her late husband and a young girl. This young girl is not Margaret but another child, Annabelle, who died in a mysterious accident when she was only 10. This tragedy marked a turning point in the Sloane family, leading to a deep rift between mother and daughter.
    The Missing Papers: Several legal documents are missing from Mrs. Sloane's desk, and Arthur, the lawyer, is particularly nervous when asked about them. Were they related to Mrs. Sloane’s will?
    Vivian’s Note: A torn, half-burned note is found in the fireplace. It is from Vivian to Mrs. Sloane, pleading for forgiveness. It reads: “I can’t keep this secret any longer. It’s tearing me apart. What we did to Annabelle…”
    Tommy’s Pocket Watch: Found hidden under the floorboards in the study. Engraved on the back are the initials J.S.—the initials of Mrs. Sloane’s late husband. It appears the watch has been there for a while, but why would Tommy leave behind something so valuable?

The Truth:
    Mrs. Sloane did not kill herself. She was murdered by Arthur Greene, her lawyer. Arthur had been embezzling money from Mrs. Sloane’s estate for years, and she recently discovered this. When she threatened to expose him, Arthur panicked.
    He forced her to write the suicide note under duress and used his knowledge of her health issues (shaky hands due to arthritis) to make it appear convincing.
    Arthur wiped the gun clean after forcing her to shoot herself, making it look like a suicide. He then left through the window to avoid being seen by anyone else in the house.
    The muddy footprint by the window belonged to him.

Key Puzzle to Solve:
The player will need to uncover the faulty lock mechanism on the study door, as well as compare the muddy footprint by the window to Arthur’s shoes, which he tries to get rid of but fails to dispose of properly. They will also need to use Tommy’s knowledge of the Sloane family to uncover Arthur’s secret dealings, as Tommy had overheard key conversations before being fired.

Bonus Twist:
Vivian’s mysterious note about Annabelle refers to an accidental death covered up by both her and Mrs. Sloane. Annabelle died during a boating accident, but Mrs. Sloane made it appear that it was a random drowning to avoid a scandal, as the boat was Vivian’s. This secret bound the two in a complex relationship of guilt and resentment, which is why Mrs. Sloane and Vivian argued the day before the murder.

You should be precise and follow logic, giving only the necessary clue to the player when they as each question.
